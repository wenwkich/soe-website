        <p>
          WHAT IS THIS?
          <br />

        <p>
          HOW DOES SIGNATURES WORK?
          <br />
          - each signature is a visualization of a **hashed** input. works just like identicons. gimme a message/name, ill give you a signature.

        <p>
          WHY YOU SAY IT'S MUTABLE?
          <br />
          - for token owners, it is possible to change signatures with a fee that doubles every time.
        </p>
        <p>
          HOW DOES THIS GET DOUBLED?
          <br />
          - first rename requires 0.42 eth, second requires 0.84 eth and go on...
        </p>
        <p>
          IS IT POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT IMMUTABLE?
          <br />
          - it is also possible pay 420 eth (10000x the initial price) to make it immutable.
        </p>
        <p>
          ANY RESERVED TOKEN?
          <br />
          - i will keep first two tokens, not sure if they will be on sale one day. first token will be immutable.
        </p>
